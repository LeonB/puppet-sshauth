sshauth
=======

ssh::auth provides centralized creation, distribution, and revocation of ssh keys for users. For full documentation please refer to http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/1/wiki/Module_Ssh_Auth_Patterns

This implementation has changed the use of virtual resources to exported resources. While it adds the burden of enabling storeconfigs,
the main advantage is that keys can be declared contextually and not at central location so the keymaster can see them.
